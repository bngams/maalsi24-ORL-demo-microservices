# This file orchestrates both infrastructure and application services
#
# Usage:
#   - Start all infrastructure: docker compose up -d
#   - Start infrastructure + AB domain: docker compose --profile ab up -d
#   - Start infrastructure + Marketplace domain: docker compose --profile marketplace up -d
#   - Start everything: docker compose --profile all up -d
#
# Note: Infrastructure services (compose-tools.yml) start by default
# Application services (compose-apps.yml) require explicit profiles
